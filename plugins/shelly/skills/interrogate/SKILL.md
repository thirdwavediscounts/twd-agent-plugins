# Interrogate

Local port of pstack `interrogate` (github.com/cursor/plugins), 2026-08-24.

Spawn one reviewer per panel seat to adversarially review code changes. Each reviewer gets the same prompt and rubric. The adversarial signal comes from diversity of reviewer and model, not assigned personas. Reviewers differ in blind spots, priors, and reasoning patterns. Agreement across reviewers is high-confidence signal; lone-reviewer findings are worth reading but lower confidence.

This is the on-demand adversarial pass, distinct from GitHub's automated PR review bot (Bugbot), which posts its own comments on open PRs as they're pushed. Run interrogate when you want a deliberate, deeper pass before or alongside that.

The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Do NOT auto-apply changes.

## Step 1, Determine Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files

Package the diff (or file contents) plus any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, State the Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent explicitly. What is this code trying to accomplish? Derive this from:

- The user's message
- Commit messages
- PR description if one exists
- The code itself

Write one clear paragraph. Reviewers challenge whether the work achieves the intent well, not whether the intent itself is correct. If you're unsure about the intent, ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

Launch all reviewers in a single message using the Agent tool. The panel is fixed:

| Reviewer | Agent | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Reviewer A | `shelly:code-reviewer` | Claude, judges against the team's standards (CLAUDE.md's four principles, `packages/guidelines/EXAMPLES.md`) |
| Reviewer B | `shelly:codex-reviewer` | GPT-5.4 cross-model adversarial pass. It wraps `.claude/scripts/codex-review-diff.sh` internally — that script is the canonical way to run Codex against the diff; don't call it directly, spawn the agent |
| Reviewer C | `shelly:security-auditor` | Auth/RLS gaps, secret leakage, injection, unsafe input handling |
| Reviewer D | `general-purpose`, model `claude-opus-4-8[1m]` | Given `references/reviewer-prompt.md` directly, same as the other three |

Read `references/reviewer-prompt.md` and fill in the template with:
1. The stated intent
2. The diff or file contents
3. The review rubric from `references/rubric.md`
4. The code-quality lens from `references/code-quality-review.md`

Reviewers A–C have their own system prompts and read-only tool access already scoped to their role; hand them the filled template as their task prompt so all four apply the same rubric and code-quality lens. Reviewer D has no built-in review prompt, so the filled template is its entire brief.

Each reviewer produces structured findings as described in the prompt template.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture:

1. **Parse all findings** from the reviewers
2. **Identify consensus**. Findings raised by 2+ reviewers independently are highest signal.
3. **Identify lone-reviewer findings**. Still worth reading, but weight accordingly.
4. **Deduplicate**. Different reviewers may describe the same issue differently. Merge these and note which reviewers raised it.
5. **Note disagreements**. If one reviewer flags something and another explicitly says the opposite, that's useful context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

Lead judgment stays with fable — this session, not any of the panel agents. You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator.

Read `references/lead-judgment.md` for the full framework. Reviewers only see a slice of the codebase. You have the full context (the goal, the constraints, the timeline, which tradeoffs were already considered). Use that context aggressively.

Categorize every finding using these buckets:

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. These would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate points, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them right now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact given the current stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context. Brief explanation why.

For each finding, include:
- Which reviewer(s) raised it
- The category (act on / consider / noted / dismissed)
- A one-line rationale for the categorization

## Output Format

Present the verdict in this structure:

### Intent
> [The stated intent paragraph from Step 2]

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [agent], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Findings that should be addressed. For each: description, which reviewers raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Findings worth thinking about. For each: description, which reviewers raised it, tradeoff involved.]

### Noted
[Valid but low-priority. Brief list.]

### Dismissed
[Rejected findings with brief rationale. This shows the user what was filtered out and why, so they can override your judgment if they disagree.]

### Agreement Map
[Where did reviewers agree, where did they diverge, and what does the pattern of agreement/disagreement tell us?]
